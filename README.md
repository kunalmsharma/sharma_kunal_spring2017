- Question 1: Please check your output and try find out the problem. 
- Question 2: Counter is not allowed to use in first two questions.
- Question 4: Miss 2nd part of the question. Try use loop to read files, imagine if you face hundreds of files to read. 
- Question 5: before compare two words list, consider lower/uppercase problem.
- Question 6: Files merging is required. Results should grouped by presidents’ name not by file name.
- Question 8: Question 8: isalpha() will remove the words like ‘4ever,gr8’ as well.

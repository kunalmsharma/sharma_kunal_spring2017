# Inference of Analysis 1

 * From the analysis we come to the conclusion that Nudity and sex seems to be a good selling point for blockbusters and the producers know it too as it is equally common in big budget movies.
 * People like to go to watch movies to which they can relate to that is why sex, nudity and relationship are the top 3 keywords in the highest grossing movies and producers and cinema houses seems to know their audience as well.

  * Which genres got maximum >= 7 ratings
  * Which genres are most profitable

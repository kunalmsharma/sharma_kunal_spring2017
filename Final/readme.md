# Inference of Analysis 1

 * From the analysis we come to the conclusion that **Nudity and sex** seems to be a good selling point for blockbusters and the producers know it too as it is equally common in big budget movies.
 * People like to go to watch movies to which they can relate to that is why sex, nudity and relationship are the top 3 keywords in the highest grossing movies and producers and cinema houses seems to know their audience as well.

# Analysis 2

 * Based on the data avialable from IMDB Dataset we find out the **Best Director** of all times by using **Facebook Like,IMDB Score and Average Revenue**

# Inference of Analysis 2

 * Based on the analysis done by comparing all the facebook likes which shows how popular a director is among masses,How much successful he is in terms of revenue generated and imdb score which evolves with time we come to the conclusion that **Christopher Nolan** is the best director.

# Analysis 3

 * Interesting to see that **Horror films have more success** at the box office compared to all movies in the dataset. 
 * Which implies that horror genre is more bankable as it's probability of being a hit is more.

# Inference of Analysis 5

 * As we can see **Drama,Comedy and Thriller** have maximum number of films in this category but if you look at it's profit it's not very much compared to other genres.
 * From the above analysis we can certainly say that genres with **more imdb score** need **not** be the most profitable genres to produce movies in.
 * As we can see that **imdb score is not directly proportional to box office collection**.
